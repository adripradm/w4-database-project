# W4 Project - Building mySQL Data-base 
This project consist to create a data base with 10 csv files, cleanig the data before introducing it into the tables.

# CLEANING AND BUILDING THE DATA-BASE
Once I opened the files I dropped some columns as they didnÂ´t add any info to the data. As the data has some lack of order we can not build a proper data base, I will use the HDD file(which we obtained the last) as the root for the project. This file is the one whose data will provide the info to do the queries, as there are 386 films uncategorized. 

Since is clear the structure of the data base we launch with python the sql connector to use the cursor to execute the data base in the SQL server and create the tables, we fill them with the clean data from the files. We build the relations between the tables and we obtain the forward engineer script of the data base. 

# QUERIES

After lookig the data base I obtained some queries with interesting conclusions, such as the most popular categories or the most prolific category. To do this queries I used the SQL connector motor creating an engine to run the queries from the jupyter notebook.
